                <h3>My Story</h3>
                    <p>Hello! Welcome! My name is Kenneth Cairney. I am a Writer and Archaeologist by education, a Web Developer and System Administrator by chance. It has been a long road from where I started to where I am. I am proud of what I have accomplished and I am happy with the road ahead. In youth it is difficult to decide where you want to be, but what matters is the perpetual pursuit of self-improvement. I have been incredibly fortunate in my experiences, and the assistance and education I have received from so many incredible people is invaluable to me. Though my university studies were a pursuit of subjects I am quite passionate about, it is often the case that our passions are not the most employable. The wonderful thing is that though I might not be working in Literature or Archaeology, they are always in my mind and always hobbies. The key is that regardless of where I work I will always pursue my continuing education. My recent step into System Administration has opened surprising doors and inspired me to rekindle another avenue of self-education. There is an abundance of languages and ideas to explore in the programming and development world, and this is just the first step on a new journey. I hope you enjoy my modest collection of work and check back to see my growth on this continuing journey.</p>
