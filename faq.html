                I start with a goal, what the site or page is trying to achieve. Then build a design for what the page will look like, based on that goal. Finally I work to build the design. I utilize different tools such as HTML, CSS, PHP or even Ruby to build up each unique project.

                It really depends on the scope of the project. If it is only a page or two, a workable version could be up inside of a week. Most projects are a bit more complicated than that and may take 2 weeks to a month to build something that works and looks professional.

                So far most of my work has been based around expanding my skills, because of this clients are usually friends, colleagues or friends of friends; but in reality they can be anyone. Those wanting to set up a simple page for their personal business, or someone looking to build a more customized blog.

                It has often been something I have fiddled with. Though I studied other subjects in university, none had the appeal of a long term skill or profession. They were often just expanded hobbies. They gave me a strong work ethic and a lot of interesting skills, but I found the more I played around with Web Development the happier I became. The things I learned have helped me to think critically of technology, and how technology operates, pushing me to learn more and more; and grow as a person.

                While I know i can succeed in almost any environment, I prefer a workplace that fosters personal growth. I am eager to be pushed, to learn new things. So anywhere where employees can learn from each other and are encouraged to grow. A company that wants to see its employees excel.
